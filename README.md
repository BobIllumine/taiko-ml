### Robert Chen, B20-AI

Project for Applied Machine Learning course.

## Installing dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run demo

You can run a demo using the command below:

```bash
python -m src.game.demo
```

It will train the model first (can take a lot of time), and then will run a PyGame window.
If you want to change the map or disable the training process, check `src/game/demo.py`.
